# vmpooler-deployment

This repo contains Dockerfiles and a Helm chart that can be used to deploy [VMPooler](https://github.com/puppetlabs/vmpooler).

## Status

This repo is a work in progress. It mostly works but many bits need adjusting here and there as they were compiled from other locations. More details will be added soon.
